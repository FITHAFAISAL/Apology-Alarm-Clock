Project Description
An alarm clock that refuses to let you sleep in peace until you either play a mind-bending inverted snake game or run out of snoozes. It also politely apologizes while waking you up‚Ä¶ which somehow makes it worse.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People wake up too easily when they really should suffer a little before getting out of bed. Alarm clocks are too forgiving ‚Äî press a button, and boom, back to sleep. No morning torture? That‚Äôs unacceptable.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created an alarm clock that:

Talks to you: ‚ÄúI am sorry to wake you up but it‚Äôs time‚Äù (so polite it‚Äôs annoying)

Allows only two snoozes (1 minute each)

Forces you to win an inverted snake game ‚Äî where left means right, and right means left ‚Äî before it stops ringing.
You‚Äôll be awake just from the frustration.
